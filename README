Title: "High School Memories" (HTML Website, 8/26/22-9/19/22)
This is a website I made for my high school advanced Java class.  This assignment required hyperlinks, a formatted letter, a form/questionaire, stylized text (bolded, italicized, and highlighted text), and other assets, such as tables, embedded videos, pdfs, and stylized lists.  I based my website on my favorite friends and experiences throughout high school, featuring many pictures and videos.  Our client call for this project was to include an aspect relating to Hispanic Heritage month, so I embedded a pdf of "A House on Mango Street," a novel that my friends and I read during freshman year.
